Welcome to the example site of the [HTML5 Hugo theme](http://github.com/simonmika/hugo-theme-html5).

It is a HTML 5 theme for the static site generator [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com). It is not a complete theme but rather a set of templates that generates the necessary HTML. It also contains some sensible CSS reset. It requires the end user to provide their custom design through CSS files.
